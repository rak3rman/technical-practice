# Technical Practice

A medley of technical practice problems used to prepare for coding interviews

**EMPLOYERS:** I've made this collection of practice problems/solutions public
soley as a method for you to guage technical skill and coding style choices.
Please, do not abuse this resource as a way to find gaps in my knowledge.

**PEERS:** Feel free to use this repository as a resource to study for
technical interviews. An important note is that *you should attempt these
problems yourself instead of blindly accepting my solution*. I firmly believe
that you learn best by doing. Study on!
