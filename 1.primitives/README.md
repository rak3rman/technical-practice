# Primitives

A set of data structure primitives written from scratch.

## Purpose

Implementing data structure primitives is a crucial first step to truly understand how algorithms work.
Writing each data structure from scratch ensures that you understand each data structure on a fundamental level.
Then you can go forth and write incredible software that *actually* manipulates data in the correct and most efficient way.
